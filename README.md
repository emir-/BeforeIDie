BeforeIDie
==========

Small weekend project for posting peoples "Before I Die" thoughts.

- Currently the UI code is hard coded in Macedonian and the codebase had very small attention in regards to security.
- If I have time  the codebase will probably be refactored or updated for multilanguage support.

Technologies
---
The project is built inside the Visual Studio 2013 preview version, using a small EF Code First project for database generation and data access.

It's also based on Bootstrap 3 and custom .less resources loaded using bundle transformations.
